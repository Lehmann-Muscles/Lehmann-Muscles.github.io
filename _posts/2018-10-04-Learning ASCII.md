    <td>At the start of the lesson we were all called to the front and Mr Keen explained what ASCII was. He then sent us back to the computers and asked us to find the values for ASCII and input them Into our spreadsheet. I struggled at first because I had the wrong values but I soon got back on track and managed to input all the values of ASCII into my spreadsheet. My spreadsheet now contains Ceasar Ciphers and ASCII values.</td>
