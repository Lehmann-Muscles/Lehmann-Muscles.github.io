<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>With no idea what excel could do</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to understand shift ciphers and put in commands into Excel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I understand what a shift cipher is and how it works and I also now know how to use the 'vlookup' command</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I didn't quite understand the shift cipher I looked at the board and looked at my own and tried to fix the problem </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning</td>
    <td>When I wasn’t sure how to use the 'vlookup’ tool I tried to ask myself what the tool was meant to do so I could try and work it out</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Instead of asking my friends for help I tried to work out and solve the problem myself</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on previous experiences and used the same strategies to solve the problem</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Instead of doing just one cipher I decided to do 2 which meant my encryption would be more random</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>When I was inputting the commands into Excel I could have looked at the information as it told me what to do. I was also quite interested in what other people were doing as I wasn't quite sure whether I was doing it right. Also I didn’t try enough things before asking one of the people around me.</td>
